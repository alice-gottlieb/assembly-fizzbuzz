# Assembly Fizzbuzz #
Implementing fizzbuzz in NASM x86 Assembly (tested on OpenSUSE Leap 15.3). Created in answer to a challenge, and as a birthday present.

* fizzbuzz.asm - runs fizzbuzz for any 2-digit number of iterations. Change ECX to change number of iteration and fizzNum and buzzNum to change how often fizz and buzz appear.
* looper.asm - simple looping behavior that counts upwards
* helloWorld.asm - you can't start learning a new language without it
